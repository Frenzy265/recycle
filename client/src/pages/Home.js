        The 3 Rs Reduce, Reuse, Recycle â€“ these three R words are an important
        part of sustainable living, as they help to cut down on the amount of
        waste we have to throw away. Its Really simple! Reduce the amount of
        waste you produce. Reuse items as much as you can before replacing them.
        Recycle items wherever possible. Using the 3 Rs also helps to minimise
        the amount of space needed for landfill sites, where waste materials are
        disposed of.
